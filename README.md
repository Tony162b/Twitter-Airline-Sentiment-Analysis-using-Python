# Twitter-Airline-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python

Sentiment analysis is a powerful marketing tool that enables businesses to understand customer emotions in their marketing campaigns. It is an essential factor in product and brand recognition, customer loyalty, customer satisfaction, advertising, promotion success, and product acceptanceâ€”understanding the psychology can benefit businesses. Customer success managers alter their product roadmap with greater precision. Understanding the psychology of customer responses can also increase product and brand recall.
Sentiment analysis can be in two categories. One category refers to individual customer service characteristics depending on how customers use the product. This second category describes the characteristics of the product in the context of the customer service experience.
In this particular case, some manor US airline s are having problems with their customers, affecting revenue. They would like to know the causes of or reasons for the decline in sales and customer satisfaction. I will be using Python to perform sentiment analysis to identify the sentiments expressed in the tweets by these major  US Airlines customers.
