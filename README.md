# Twitter-Airline-Sentiment-Classification

Sentiment analysis is a powerful marketing tool that enables businesses to understand customer emotions in their marketing campaigns. It is an essential factor in product and brand recognition, customer loyalty, customer satisfaction, advertising, promotion success, and product acceptanceâ€”understanding the psychology can benefit businesses. Customer success managers alter their product roadmap with greater precision. Understanding the psychology of customer responses can also increase product and brand recall.

Sentiment analysis can be in two categories. One category refers to individual customer service characteristics depending on how customers use the product. This second category describes the characteristics of the product in the context of the customer service experience.
In this particular case, some manor US airline s are having problems with their customers, affecting revenue. They would like to know the causes of or reasons for the decline in sales and customer satisfaction. I will be using Python to perform sentiment analysis to identify the sentiments expressed in the tweets by these major  US Airlines customers.

Performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data usually involves four steps:

Gather Twitter data 

Preprocess/prepare the data

Train and test a Sentiment Analysis model Visualize 

Verify the results

I will be using the following three models :

1.Random Forest https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html# 

2.Gaussian Naive Bayes https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.html#

3.Support vector machines (SVM)-https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html

Dataset: The dataset is borrowed from Kaggle @ https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment .
